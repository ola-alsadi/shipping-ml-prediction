# Applying Machine Learning to Shipping 🚢📦

This project explores the application of **machine learning techniques** to real-world shipping data.  
The goal was to predict shipment prices and classify shipments based on various attributes such as weight, dimensions, and destination.  
We also applied unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings in the data.

## 📊 Dataset
- 7,000 shipping records  
- Features: price, weight, dimensions, shipment date, destination port  
- Preprocessing: missing value imputation, feature engineering (volume, density, weekday/weekend), scaling, encoding  

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
- **Regression**
  - Random Forest Regressor (baseline & tuned)
  - XGBoost Regressor
- **Classification**
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Clustering**
  - KMeans Clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction

## 🔎 Results
- **Regression**
  - RMSE improved from 4.34 → 1.14 after tuning  
  - R² improved from 0.55 → 0.58  
- **Classification**
  - Accuracy improved from ~79.6% → ~81%  
- **Clustering**
  - Silhouette score > 0.55 (well-separated clusters)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Google Colab (GPU support, collaboration)  

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Learned hands-on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization  
- Gained experience in regression, classification, clustering, and hyperparameter tuning  
- Improved model performance through iterative development and evaluation
